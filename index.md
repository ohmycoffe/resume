## Experience

### Software Engineer | Paramount
*April 2023 - Present | Warsaw, Poland*

Developing and maintaining an internal system for managing advertising campaigns in the advanced advertisement area. I primarily work on backend services (`FastAPI`, `Flask`, `Tornado`). My responsibilities include gathering requirements from product owners, collaborating with the data science team to design the best technical solutions, implementing them, and maintaining them in production. I am also heavily involved in developing CI/CD pipelines (`GitHub`) and ETLs (`Argo Workflows`). My role focuses on ensuring the reliability, scalability, and performance of the systems I work on, optimizing queries and data models to efficiently handle large volumes of data in both `PostgreSQL` and `Snowflake`.


### Python Developer and R&D Specialist | National Centre for Nuclear Research
*August 2015 - March 2023 | Warsaw, Poland*

- Led end-to-end development of data processing tools and advanced optimization models in `Python` using `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Gurobi`, creating solutions to optimize Poland‚Äôs energy mix, manage power flows, and ensure grid reliability. Processed large datasets efficiently, simulated multiple electricity supply scenarios, and identified cost-effective, low-emission strategies. These models were applied in **two published research papers** on energy security and power system management.

- Developed a tool to estimate outage costs for the Polish transmission system. The Polish TSO used this tool to justify several critical investments, applying **Monte Carlo** simulations and parallel computing on NCBJ clusters to evaluate multiple large-scale scenarios efficiently. The tool implemented complex optimization model (MILP) written in `Gurobi`.

- Built from scratch a `PostgreSQL` + `PostGIS` system, integrating geospatial data from Geoportal and other public sources to enable fast, scalable analysis for energy and infrastructure planning. Implemented backend data scraping and processing in `Python` using `GeoPandas`, `SqlAlchemy`, and `Alembic` for efficient handling of large datasets. Developed several **spatial data algorithms**, including methods for calculating distances between buildings and linear objects (e.g., gas pipes, power lines), which were also applied in my Master‚Äôs thesis.

- Developed a `Streamlit` app to optimize cost-efficient solar installations for individual buildings in the prosumer system. Implemented the optimization as a **linear model** using the `GLPK` solver and deployed on `AWS EC2`.

-  Developed the zefir.app application to optimize municipality energy mix and managed a small development team. Worked on the backend with `FastAPI`, `SqlAlchemy`,`Alembic` and data pipelines with `Apache Airflow`, coordinating closely with the `React` frontend to ensure smooth feature delivery and reliable data workflows.
