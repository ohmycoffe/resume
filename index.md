## Professional Summary

I am a software developer with 5+ years of Python experience and the co-author of two
papers in the field of electrical engineering. I deeply value collaboration, sharing knowledge, and working together to
solve challenging problems.

## Experience

### Software Engineer | Paramount
*April 2023 - Present | Warsaw, Poland*

- TBD

**Technologies:** `Python`, `PostgreSQL`, `Kubernetes`, `AWS`,

### Python Developer and R&D Specialist | National Centre for Nuclear Research
*August 2015 - March 2023 | Warsaw, Poland*

I am responsible for developing tools for data processing (numpy, pandas), optimization
models using gurobipy library. I am working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, sqlalchemy)
and I build CI/CD pipelines in gitlab to assure good quality code development in my team. I
am also a mentor for newcomers.
- I developed a tool for processing optimization of polish energy-mix considering
different scenarios. The tool has been used to create the report for polish transmission
power system operator: ‚ÄûAn analysis of alternative scenarios for ensuring continuity
of electricity supply while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions‚Äù ‚Äì I am a co-author.
- I have created an app (CLI) for estimating costs of outages in polish transmission
system. The tool was developed for polish transmission system operator. I have used
Monte Carlo method and parallel computing techniques utilizing computing clusters
owned by NCBJ.
- I have created a tool for optimizing most cost-efficient solar installation for given
building assuming participating in prosumer system. The tool was created in
streamlit framework and deployed as a docker container.
- I have developed a database supporting geospatial indexes which integrates publicly
available information about buildings in Poland. I have created API clients using
multithreading concepts to fetch requested data and I have been using PostgreSQL
database with PostGiS extension, SQLAlchemy, pydantic, numpy and pandas for data
processing.
- I was maintaining zefir.app application in terms of i) creating new endpoints in
FastAPI framework and ii) configuring DAGs for processing results in Apache Airflow.
- I was responsible for modeling and analyzing power systems both in a static and dynamic
approach. I was exploring the sensitivity of changes in power flows in the power grid (using
matrix transformations). Also I was calculating optimal power flows using linear
optimization models (Matlab). The research was commissioned by the Polish Transmission
System Operator.
