# Resume Website
This is a resume website built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages: https://ohmycoffe.github.io/resume

You don't need to install Jekyll locally to maintain the site, because GitHub Actions automatically handles the build and deployment. Just edit the index.md file and push your changes to the main branch.

If youâ€™d like to preview changes locally, follow the instructions below.
